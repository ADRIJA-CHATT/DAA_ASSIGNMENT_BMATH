"Once upon a time there was a sparrow and a crow. The sparrow’s house was on a neem tree, small and very beautiful. The sparrow was hardworking and didn’t like sitting idly at home. She would clean her house every day, keeping it bright and tidy. The crow’s house, however, was messy and dirty, and he never cared to clean it. He would spend the whole day cawing loudly and making noise, disturbing everyone around. No one liked visiting him because of his constant shouting. One day, dark clouds gathered in the sky, a strong wind blew, and heavy rain began. The crow’s nest got drenched, and water started entering his house. 'Caw, caw!' cried the crow. He didn’t know where to go, then remembered that the sparrow lived nearby. He went to her house, but she had already closed her door tightly. The crow called out, 'Chiutai, Chiutai, open the door!' From inside, the sparrow said, 'Wait a bit, I’m applying Kajal and powder on my baby.' After waiting a while, the crow knocked again and called out loudly, 'Chiutai, Chiutai, open the door!' The sparrow replied, 'Wait I'm putting my baby to sleep.' Meanwhile, the rainwater kept rising, what could the poor one do! He stood there making a small face. After making the baby sleep, the sparrow opened the door. The crow entered the house. Due to being wet the crow felt extremely cold. The sparrow told him, 'Go sit near the stove.' On top of the stove was Kheer! The crow's mouth started watering. Little by little he ate the entire Kheer. Just in a bit more time the rain stopped. The crow opened the back door of the house and flew away immediately. That's how the crow was lazy and cunning.
