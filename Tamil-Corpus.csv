"The groves overflow with sweet nectar,
the champak forests stand thick with trees,
the ponds are filled with buds slowly opening into blossoms,
and the tanks shimmer with fresh, clean sand along their edges.
There are areca gardens fenced with climbing plants and entwining creepers,
and lush paddy fields stretching wide.
Through all these — the groves, the forests, the ponds, the gardens, and the fields —
flows and spreads the Sarayu River.

It moves gracefully from place to place,
as though a single living soul were passing through many different bodies,
bringing life, freshness, and motion wherever it goes.","Poetry expresses itself through the poet. 
If the way it comes is changed, its beauty diminishes. 
The recurring rhythm repeatedly instills feelings within us. 
The heart is plundered.

In every garden where the “tha-thuku” grove stands, in every champak forest
in every pond where lotuses bloom, in every place filled with new fragrance
in every jasmine-fenced grove, in every field  
through every part of the reciting body, life vibrates like a living soul indeed."
