“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The, er, sitting
room, why don’t you use that?”
“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will be no need
for you to accompany us, Arthur.”
Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as
he, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in
silence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was:
Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were
planning to drop out of Hogwarts.
Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen
and into the Burrow’s sitting room. Although the garden had been full of
soft golden evening light, it was already dark in here: Harry flicked his
wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but
cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr.
Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze
side by side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke.
“I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if
we do it individually. If you two” — he pointed at Harry and Hermione —
“can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.”
“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded
vigorously. “You can speak to us together, or not at all.”
Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression
that the Minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening
hostilities this early.
“Very well then, together,” he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. “I
am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore’s will.”
