"It was unbearably hot. I was lying quietly under the shade of a tree, yet sweating restlessly. My handkerchief was lying on the grass — as I picked it up to wipe my face, the thing suddenly said, 'Meow!' Good heavens! Why on earth would a handkerchief meow? I looked up — and lo and behold, the handkerchief wasn’t a handkerchief anymore. In its place sat a plump, bright red cat, whiskers puffed out, staring right at me with round unblinking eyes. I said, 'Well, this is strange! You were a handkerchief, and now you’ve turned into a cat!' The cat promptly replied, 'What’s strange about that? An egg becomes a duck, doesn’t it? Perfectly ordinary transformation, happens all the time!' I thought for a while and asked, 'Then what should I call you now? You’re not a real cat — deep down, you’re still a handkerchief.' The cat said, 'Call me a cat if you like, or a handkerchief, or even Chandrabindu (a nasal diacritic) if that pleases you.' 'Chandrabindu? Why Chandrabindu?' I asked. The cat squinted one eye and let out the most ridiculous laugh imaginable. 'Oh, you don’t know that?' it said, chuckling nastily. I felt thoroughly embarrassed. Surely, I was supposed to know what it meant by Chandrabindu. Flustered, I blurted out quickly, 'Oh yes, yes, of course I understand!' The cat beamed. 'Ha! I knew it! See — ‘Cha’ from Chandrabindu, the palatal ‘Sha’ from Biral (cat), and the ‘Ma’ from Rumal (handkerchief) — together they make Chashma! (spectacles). Clever, isn’t it?'","It's so hot. I'm lying quietly in the shade of a tree, but I'm still sweating. The handkerchief was on the grass, and as I went to pick it up to wipe my sweat, the handkerchief said, 'Meow!' What a disaster! Why is the handkerchief meowing? I looked and saw that the handkerchief was no longer a handkerchief, but a fat, red cat was looking at me with its whiskers puffed out and patted. I said, 'What a problem! It was a handkerchief, but it turned into a cat!' The cat immediately said, 'What a problem? It was an egg, but it turned into a duckling. This happens all the time.' I thought for a moment and said, 'Then what should I call you now? You're not a real cat, you're actually a handkerchief.' The cat said, 'You can say cat, you can say handkerchief, you can say moonspot.' I said, 'Why moonspots?' Hearing this, the cat said, 'You don't know that either?' and started laughing awkwardly, closing one eye. I was completely unprepared. I thought, I should have understood what that moonspot was saying. I was shocked and quickly said, 'Oh, yes, I understand.' The cat said happily, 'Yes, it makes sense - moonspots are the 'C', cat's 'S', handkerchief's 'M' - glasses. How are you?'"
