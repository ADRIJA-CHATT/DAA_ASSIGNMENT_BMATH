"My saffron love, come
Please come to my land

I call you my love
I am attached to your heart
I keep you in my wraps
And look at you all the time","The saffron-colored lover has come,
I want to study in my country.

My beloved, I want to come, 
My beloved, my heart is burning.
My beloved, my earrings,
I come every now and then."
