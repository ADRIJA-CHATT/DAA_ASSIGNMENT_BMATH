"For centuries, crows were already black; 
But, there was happiness even in 'blackness'.
There was no regret due to hue.
Nor existed any kind of proverbial clue: 
""Crows everywhere black, always!!""
One crow fabricated a false case; 
He coloured himself with a white shade.
As a God, he kept on being worshipped in the whole community.
But, during the first shower of monsoon itself the colour faded.
A fraud crow brought disgrace to whole community:
Crows are everywhere black, always...!! 
Having been sad by this saying excessively, 
One crow did a penance rigorously; 
And received a 'white' boon...!! Being blessed with a boon- 
he came to community. 
But who will accept? 
The community took him under control absolutely; 
He was made half-dead nearly, 
drowning into water frequently; Nevertheless, the colour remained white exceptionally...!! 
His skin was taken off, subsequently, 
And he turned into eventually- A 'red crow' 
Black are not all crows, inevitably...!!","Crows were black for centuries;
But, there was fun – even in 'black'.
There was no problem with the color.
Nor was there any proverb:
'Crows... are all black!!'
A crow felt a desire;
Painted itself with white paint.
Becoming a god, it started being worshipped by the entire village. But, the color washed away in the first rain of the monsoon.
The stigma of a single crow was felt by the entire village:
'Crows... are all black!!'
Saddened by this proverb, a crow did severe penance;
And got – 'white' boon..!!
He took the boon – to the village.
But, who would believe
The village took him hostage;
He was drowned in water and left half dead;
And yet his color was white and white...!!
Then, his skin was peeled off,
And finally he became -
'Red Crow'
Not all crows are black...!!"
